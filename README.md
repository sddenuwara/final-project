# File Description

LOGIN ACCOUNT THAT HAS DATA
- Since the add expense feature was not added, I created an admin account that already has a couple of expenses added to showcase the configure and dashbaord pages
- email: admin@admin.com
- password: password

- Both the server and the front-end are both deployed on Digital Ocean as two different apps
- The login and the signup features should both work
- Once signed up, the server automatically adds "N/A" to their budget as a placeholder before real data is added
- CORS, for some reason, does not behave normally. For this reason, if the site is blocked due to CORS, either try reloading or disabling CORS
